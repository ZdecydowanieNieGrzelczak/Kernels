Linux Zen 5.15 for Arch Linux - tuned for performance <br/>

A lot of changes aiming for performance improvements. <br/>
Removed drivers for most of the irrelevant devices. <br/>
Disabled a lot of functionality - we will see if this will be running. <br/>
Virtualization is on - it seems that Proton (or Wine) needs it.
